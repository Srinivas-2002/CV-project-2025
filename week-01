Week 1 Progress Report

Project Title: Real-Time Face Recognition System
Duration: Week 1 (November 3–9, 2025)

🎯 1. Objectives for the Week

Establish a clear understanding of the overall project goal and expected outcomes.

Design the initial technical pipeline and workflow for the real-time face recognition system.

Begin core development by implementing foundational modules for data collection, training, and recognition.

🧠 2. Work Completed
Module	Status	Description
Project Setup & Overview	✅ Completed	Defined project scope, objectives, and use cases (e.g., real-time identification, automated attendance). Selected core technologies — Python, OpenCV, and face recognition libraries (FaceNet/ArcFace).
Data Gathering Script	✅ Completed	Created a Python script using OpenCV to capture training images via webcam. Structured dataset folders by user to ensure organized storage.
Training Module	✅ Completed	Implemented feature extraction and model training pipeline: detected faces, generated 128D embeddings, and trained a KNN/SVM classifier for recognition. Saved the model and encodings for reuse.
Real-Time Recognition Module	✅ Implemented	Developed the real-time recognition loop capable of processing webcam input, performing detection, encoding, and matching at ~30 FPS with accurate labeling.
Repository Structure	✅ Organized	Organized project files into modules (create_dataset.py, train_model.py, recognizer.py) following modular and scalable code design principles.
⚙️ 3. Technical Summary

Training & Preparation Workflow: Completed offline training pipeline — including data collection, preprocessing, embedding generation, and model training.

Real-Time Pipeline: Achieved functional real-time recognition using live webcam input and integrated visualization (bounding boxes and labels).

Performance: Initial testing on local datasets demonstrates reliable recognition with minimal latency on CPU.

🚀 4. Challenges & Solutions
Challenge	Resolution
Handling variations in lighting during dataset creation	Adjusted camera exposure and added basic histogram equalization preprocessing.
Ensuring stable real-time FPS	Optimized OpenCV video capture parameters and limited frame resolution for smooth streaming.
📈 5. Outcomes

A fully functional end-to-end face recognition prototype demonstrating live identification.

Established a solid technical foundation for future optimization, benchmarking, and interface design.

🔮 6. Next Week’s Focus

Integrate improved face alignment to handle angled faces.

Begin performance benchmarking and explore GPU acceleration.

Start drafting evaluation metrics for model performance.

Plan for an optional GUI interface for user-friendly interaction.

Would you like me to format this into a Markdown file (week-01.md) you can directly upload to your GitHub repository? I can also make it look visually appealing with emojis, tables, and section dividers suitable for GitHub display.
